# VOICE TO GPT


Voice-to-GPT is a web application that allows users to interact with an AI assistant using voice commands. The application records users' voice input, transcribes it, and sends the transcribed text to OpenAI's GPT-4 for processing. The AI assistant responds with an answer, which is then converted back to speech and played to the user.

## **functionalities:**

* Voice input: Users can speak their questions or commands directly into their microphone.
* Automatic speech recognition (ASR): The application transcribes users' voice input using Whisper ASR.
* AI assistant: The transcribed text is sent to OpenAI's GPT-4, which processes the input and generates an appropriate response.
* Text-to-speech (TTS): The AI assistant's response is converted back to speech and played to the user.
* Please follow the instructions in the "Installation" section to set up and run the application.
